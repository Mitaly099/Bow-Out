                     <h4>Bad habits that affects Heart:</h4>
                     <p><strong>1) Smoking.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>2) Dining out every night.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>3) Not staying active.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>4) Getting too stressed out.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>5) Having a few too many cocktails.</strong></p>
                     <h4>Home Remedies:</h4>
                     <p><strong>Almonds: </strong>
                        When heart pain occurs after eating, acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may be to blame. Both conditions may cause intense chest pain. Many people claim that eating a handful of almonds or drinking almond milk when heartburn strikes eases symptoms.
                        The evidence is anecdotal and there’s not enough scientific data to support this claim. Almonds are an alkaline food and in theory, they may help to soothe and neutralize acid in the esophagus.
                        On the other hand, almonds are high in fat. For some people, fat triggers acid reflux. Fatty foods may cause the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and allow acid to flow backwards into the esophagus.</p>
                        
                     <p><strong>Apple cider vinegar: </strong>
                        Drinking a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with a glass of water before meals or when heart pain strikes is another home remedy for acid reflux. There’s little scientific evidence to show that apple cider vinegar eases heartburn. Still, many people swear it works.
                        Some people experience acid reflux because their stomach doesn’t produce enough acid. In this case, apple cider vinegar may help by increasing the amount of acid in the stomach. The compound that gives apple cider vinegar its tang is acetic acid. It may help break down food and support digestion.
                        Apple cider vinegar doesn’t cause side effects in most people. However, it may thin your blood and should be used with caution if you take blood thinners.</p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Drinking a hot drink: </strong>
                        Gas is a common cause of chest pain. A hot or warm drink may help rev up your digestive system and ease gas and bloating. Hot hibiscus tea, in particular, supports digestion and heart health. Research shows hibiscus helps lower blood pressure and reduces cholesterol and triglycerides. Hibiscus is generally recognized as safe to consume.</p>
                        
                     <p><strong>Apply a cold pack: </strong>
                        Heart pain is sometimes caused by chest muscle strain. Weightlifting, a fall, or even carrying a child or a heavy laundry basket may all be culprits. Costochondritis, which is an inflammation of the chest wall, is often the source of severe chest pain. Applying a cold pack several times a day to the affected area may help reduce inflammation and ease pain.</p>

                        <h4>Bad habits that affects Kidney:</h4>
                     <p><strong>1) Drinking too much Alcohol.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>2) Not emptying your bladder early.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>3) Not treating common infections quickly & properly.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>4) Prolonged insulin supplements.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>5) Not drinking enough water.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>6) Eating too much meat.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>7) Taking too much salt.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>8) Not resting enough.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>9) Not eating enough.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>10) Painkiller abuse.</strong></p>
                     <h4>Home Remedies:</h4>
                     <p><strong>Drink lots of water: </strong>
                        Drinking plenty of water can help flush bacteria from the body, helping eliminate the infection faster. It can also help clear out the entire urinary system.
                        Drinking plenty of water can also help prevent UTIs that can lead to kidney infections, so it’s a good practice to keep. Aim to drink at least eight glasses of fluids daily.</p>
                        
                     <p><strong>Drink cranberry juice: </strong>
                        Cranberry juice has long been used as a remedy for UTIs and bladder infections. There’s some evidence that drinking cranberry juice may help or prevent UTIs in some people.
                        Many people prefer the sweet flavor of cranberry juice to water, helping them drink more. However, cranberry juices full of added sweeteners aren’t great for you. A cranberry supplement or pure cranberry juice is a better alternative to get the benefits of cranberries.</p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Avoid alcohol and coffee: </strong>
                        The kidneys’ most important role is to filter out harmful substances and toxins, and both alcohol and caffeine can require extra work from the kidneys. This may hinder the process of healing from an infection. Alcohol and antibiotics also shouldn’t be mixed, so avoid alcohol during your treatment for this reason as well.</p>
                        
                     <p><strong>Take probiotics: </strong>
                        Probiotics have two big benefits when it comes to treating kidney infections. The first is that they’ll help keep your body’s healthy bacteria in check, even though the antibiotics may get rid of both “good” and “bad” bacteria.
                        There’s also evidence that probiotics can aid in decreasing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in patients.</p>

                     <p><strong>Get some vitamin C: </strong>
                        Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect tissues in the body from oxidative stress, which can help promote kidney health.</p>
                        
                     <p><strong>Consume apples and apple juice: </strong>
                        Apples are also nutrient-dense. Their high acid content may help the kidneys maintain acidity in the urine, possibly inhibiting further growth of bacteria.</p>

                        <h4>Bad habits that affects Brain:</h4>
                     <p><strong>1) Skipping breakfast.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>2) Eating junk food.</strong></p>

                     <p><strong>9) Alcohol consumption.</strong></p>
                     <h4>Home Remedies:</h4>
                     <p><strong>Sage: </strong>
                        A spice known for its pungent scent, sage might also improve cognition and aid in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In fact, a research review published in 2017, suggests sage contains compounds that may be beneficial for cognitive and neurological function.</p>
                        
                     <p><strong>Turmeric: </strong>
                        Turmeric is a spice long used in Ayurveda. It contains a compound called curcumin, which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Turmeric may boost brain health and stave off Alzheimer's disease by clearing the brain of beta-amyloid (a protein fragment). The buildup of beta-amyloid is known to form Alzheimer's-related brain plaques. In addition, turmeric may shield brain health by inhibiting the breakdown of nerve cells in the brain.</p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Ginkgo biloba: </strong>
                        Long used as a treatment for dementia, ginkgo biloba is a commonly taken remedy in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and well known for its benefits. It's thought that ginkgo biloba might help improve cognitive function in part by stimulating circulation and promoting blood flow to the brain.</p>
                        
                     <p><strong>Ashwagandha: </strong>
                        Another Ayurvedic herb, ashwagandha has been found to inhibit the formation of beta-amyloid plaques in preliminary research, according to a review study published in 2010.</p>

                        <p><strong>Gotu Kola: </strong>
                        In alternative medicine systems such as Ayurveda and TCM, Gotu kola has long been used to improve mental clarity. Findings from animal-based research suggest that this herb may also help the brain by fighting oxidative stress.</p>

                        <h4>Home Remedies:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Drinking water: </strong>
                           The body needs water to digest and absorb nutrients from foods and beverages efficiently. Being dehydrated makes digestion more difficult and less effective, which increases the likelihood of an upset stomach.</p>
                           
                        <p><strong>Avoiding lying down: </strong>
                           When the body is horizontal, the acid in the stomach is more likely to travel backward and move upward, which can cause heartburn.
                           People with an upset stomach should avoid lying down or going to bed for at least a few hours until it passes. Someone who needs to lie down should prop up their head, neck, and upper chest with pillows, ideally at a 30-degree angle.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Ginger: </strong>
                           Ginger contains chemicals called gingerols and shogaols that can help speed up stomach contractions. This may move foods that are causing indigestion through the stomach more quickly.
                           The chemicals in ginger may also help to reduce nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
                           People with an upset stomach could try adding ginger to their food or drinking it as a tea. Some all-natural ginger ales may also contain enough ginger to settle an upset stomach.</p>
                           
                        <p><strong>Mint: </strong>
                           Mint prevents vomiting and diarrhea. Reduces muscle spasms in the intestines. Relieves pain.</p>
